There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Concept Mapper

## Sub-Heading ##
  > For anyone who wants to draw concept maps quickly and beautifully

## Summary ##
  > Concept Mapper lets you concept maps easily. All you have to do is type your ideas and how
  they are related and a concept map will be automatically drawn for you. You can save the maps
  to your account and share them with friends and colleagues.

## Problem ##
  > Concept maps are great tools for anyone who wants to visualize relationships between ideas. There are many software tools for drawing concept maps, but most of them ask the users to make the drawings themselves. This inevitably leads to much time wasted on designing the look of the map.

## Solution ##
  > Concept mapper simplifies the map drawing process by automatically drawing concept maps based relationships that you enter.

## Quote from You ##
  > "Concept mapper harnesses the power of visualization tools to turn your ideas into elegantly drawn maps."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Concept mapper is super easy to use. Just type in 2 ideas and the relationship between them, and a concept map will be drawn for you. With an account, you can save these maps and share with friends anc colleagues.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "As a project manager, I used to spend all day drawing up task maps to present at meetings. Now I can do that in a fraction of the time!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Sign up for a Concept Mapper account and make your own concept maps in seconds!
